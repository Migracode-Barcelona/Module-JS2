// Predict and explain first...

// This program attempts to log out all the property values in the object.
// But it isn't working. Explain why first and then fix the problem

const author = {
  firstName: "Zadie",
  lastName: "Smith",
  occupation: "writer",
  age: 40,
  alive: true,
};

for (const value of Object.values(author)) {
  console.log(value);
}

//  The author object is not an iterable, so the loop cannot directly work with it.
// Object.values(author) returns an array of the values from the author object.
